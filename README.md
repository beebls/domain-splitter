# Domain Splitter
 A simple tool for finding possible shortened domains

## How To Use
Just add your word or phrase of choice to the text box and click submit.

## Technical Stuff
I originally made this entirely in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS,
after I realized I was too lazy to write css, I added tailwind and then Vite to compile it.
Still all vanilla JS though.

No backend, just a simple loop that runs on an array of domain extensions.
